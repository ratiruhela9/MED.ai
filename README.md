The Disease Prediction Website uses Machine Learning to predict potential diseases based on user-reported symptoms. 
The website not only predicts the disease but also recommends a personalized diet, workout, and necessary precautions to help the user manage the condition. 
This mini project has been enhanced with additional features to provide a comprehensive health-related solution.

## Features
Symptom-based Disease Prediction: Users can input symptoms, and the ML model predicts potential diseases.
Personalized Diet Recommendations: Based on the predicted disease, users receive a tailored diet plan to help manage their condition.
Customized Workout Plans: The website suggests specific workout routines to improve health.
Precautions: Provides necessary precautions or lifestyle changes to prevent the disease from worsening.

## Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Backend: Flask (Python)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (for disease prediction model)
